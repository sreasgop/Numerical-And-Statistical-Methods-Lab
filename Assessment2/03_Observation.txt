QUESTION: 
3. Observing the difference tables, deduce the nature of the function y = f(x).



ANSWER: 
By observing the forward and backward difference table, you can infer the nature of the function y = f(x). 
Here, we can see that the second-order difference are constant, which suggest the function is quadratic in nature. 
Thus the function appears to be in the form of f(x) = axÂ²+bx+c, which matches the given data points.
