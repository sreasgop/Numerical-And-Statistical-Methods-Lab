# üñ•Ô∏è TIU-UMA-MD-L2201 Numerical and Statistical Methods Lab

This repository contains all the questions and solutions (source code) for the subject **TIU-UMA-MD-L2201 Numerical and Statistical Methods Lab**, which is taught in the **2nd Year, 4th Semester** of the BCA Hons Course at Techno India University.

The repository consists of three folder. The folder `Lab_Assignments` contains all the C source code files of Practical classes, each named according to the question number.

## ü§ì How to use the source code

To use the source code, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use any C compiler that supports the C99 standard, such as GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio. Below are instructions on how to install and use GCC on different operating systems:

### Installing GCC on Windows:

- Download MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
- Run the installer and select `gcc` from the list of packages
- Add `MinGW/bin` to your system path
- Open a command prompt and type:
  ```bash
  gcc --version
  ```
  to verify that GCC is installed

### Installing GCC on Linux:

- Most Linux distributions come with GCC pre-installed. If not, you can install it using your package manager:
  - On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install gcc
    ```
  - On Fedora or Red Hat-based systems:
    ```bash
    sudo yum install gcc
    ```
- Open a terminal and type:
  ```bash
  gcc --version
  ```
  to verify that GCC is installed

### Installing GCC on Mac:

- Install Xcode (Apple's development environment) from [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- Xcode comes with GCC and other essential tools
- Open a terminal and type:
  ```bash
  gcc --version
  ```
  to verify that GCC is installed

### Compiling a C program using GCC:

```bash
gcc -o output_file input_file.c
```

where `output_file` is the name of the executable file that will be generated and `input_file.c` is the name of the C source code file containing your program.

### Running a C program after compilation:

```bash
./output_file
```

where `output_file` is the name of the executable file generated by GCC. You may need to use `./` before the file name to indicate that it is in the current directory.
